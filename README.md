# Distracted-Driver-model-
The objective of the project is to solve a real life problem of distracted driving. Road accidents are the major cause of deaths and have been continuously increasing in last few years around the world. As per the overview of National Highway Activity Security Chairman, about one in five motor vehicle crashes are caused by distracted drivers. In this project we have attempted to create a strong framework for detecting distracted driver and to provide caution against it. Inspired by the execution of Convolutional Neural Systems in computer vision, we show a CNN based framework that not only detects the diverted driver but also distinguishes the cause of distraction. We have deployed two types of models in our project. Using the Sequential model from keras, we were able to achieve an accuracy of 97% while the other model used was SVM and gridsearchCV in python. The second model gave us an accuracy of 98% on the test dataset.
